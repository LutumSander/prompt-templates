SCORING FRAMEWORK (Total = 100 points):

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. ICP JOB TITLE MATCH (60 points maximum)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: EXTRACT CURRENT JOB TITLE(S)

From results[0].experience[], filter where is_current: true

**If multiple current positions:**
- Primary position: Usually first in list or longest duration
- Consider all current roles (may have multiple part-time/consulting roles)
- Choose highest-ranking role for scoring

**Job Title Normalization:**
Clean the title field:
- Remove company name if embedded
- Remove emojis (⚙️, 🥾, etc.)
- Remove location indicators
- Remove extra descriptors
- Standardize to match persona titles

Examples:
- "GTME @ StackOptimise ⚙️" → "GTME" or "Go-To-Market Engineer"
- "Clay Coach " → "Clay Coach"
- "HR Manager" → "HR Manager"

STEP 2: MATCH TO PERSONAS

From Buyer_Personas.md, review all personas and their "Job Titles & Variations".

Assign to HIGHEST matching tier:

**Tier 1 (60 points) - Primary Decision Makers:**
- Match to personas marked as "C-suite/VP level" or "primary decision makers"
- Clear budget authority and strategic oversight
- Titles like: VP, Chief Officer, Head of Department (at senior level)
- Examples from Buyer_Personas.md: [List Tier 1 personas]

**Tier 2 (50 points) - Strategic Leaders:**
- Match to personas marked as "Director level" or "Department heads"
- Strong influence on purchasing decisions
- Titles like: Director, Senior Manager, Department Head
- Examples from Buyer_Personas.md: [List Tier 2 personas]

**Tier 3 (35 points) - Active Professionals:**
- Match to personas marked as "Manager level" or "Senior individual contributors"
- Day-to-day users and recommenders
- Titles like: Manager, Senior Specialist, Lead
- Examples from Buyer_Personas.md: [List Tier 3 personas]

**Tier 4 (20 points) - Junior Roles:**
- Match to personas marked as "Individual contributors" or "Specialists"
- Limited decision authority but may influence
- Titles like: Specialist, Coordinator, Associate
- Examples from Buyer_Personas.md: [List Tier 4 personas]

**Tier 5 (10 points) - Adjacent Roles:**
- Roles mentioned as "secondary" or "adjacent" in Buyer_Personas.md
- Peripheral involvement in decision-making
- May be influencers or end users

**No Match (0 points):**
- Roles not listed in any persona in Buyer_Personas.md
- Clearly outside target personas
- Non-relevant job functions

MATCHING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Check basic_info.headline for additional title context
- Review experience.description for role responsibilities (if available)
- Consider experience.skills[] for relevant skill indicators
- If title unclear, use headline and description to infer

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
2. COMPANY CONTEXT (25 points maximum)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: IDENTIFY CURRENT COMPANY

From results[0].basic_info.current_company:
- Primary company name
- Or extract from first is_current: true experience entry

**If multiple current positions:**
- Primary company: Usually listed first
- Consider which company is most relevant
- Note if person has multiple roles (consultant, advisor, etc.)

STEP 2: ASSESS COMPANY CHARACTERISTICS

From ICP_Profile.md, review:
- "Company Size" section (ideal employee ranges)
- "Industries We Target" section
- "Geographic Markets" section

**Company Size Assessment:**

You won't have employee count in person profile data, but infer from:
- Company name recognition (well-known companies = larger)
- Multiple office locations mentioned in experience.location
- Job title sophistication (VP at startup vs VP at enterprise)
- Description complexity in experience.description

Score based on inferred fit to ICP_Profile.md ranges:

**Perfect Fit (25 points):**
- Company characteristics strongly suggest size in "sweet spot" from ICP_Profile.md
- Industry clearly matches (if determinable)
- Geography in "Primary Markets"

**Strong Fit (20 points):**
- Company likely in "acceptable range" from ICP_Profile.md
- Industry appears to match or adjacent
- Geography in secondary markets

**Moderate Fit (15 points):**
- Company possibly in acceptable range
- Industry might fit
- Serviceable geography

**Weak Fit (10 points):**
- Limited company context available
- Size/industry unclear but not disqualifying
- Geography unknown or less ideal

**Cannot Determine (8 points):**
- Insufficient company information
- Cannot assess size, industry, or location
- Note in justification

**Poor Fit (0 points):**
- Company clearly doesn't match ICP_Profile.md criteria
- Wrong industry (if determinable)
- Geography in excluded markets

STEP 3: GEOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT

From results[0].basic_info.location.full:
- Extract country and region
- Match against ICP_Profile.md "Geographic Markets"

Consider:
- Person's location may differ from company HQ
- Remote workers may be anywhere
- Location indicates market they serve

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3. PROFILE QUALITY & DECISION-MAKING SIGNALS (15 points maximum)

- basic_info.is_creator (content creator status)

STEP 2: ASSESS DECISION-MAKING SIGNALS

From matched persona in Buyer_Personas.md:

Compare to profile data:

From basic_info.creator_hashtags[] (if is_creator: true):
- Do hashtags align with our market?
- Topics they create content about indicate focus areas

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Include:
- Current title(s)
- Current company/companies
- Key responsibilities (from description if available)
